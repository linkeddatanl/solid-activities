# Home pods

The original idea for Home pods or Home vault (a Huiskluis in Dutch) dates back from late 2012 and the concept for a home vault was described in the first PLDN publication in 2013 in the chapter [Huiskluis: basis voor nieuwe diensten](https://www.pldn.nl/wiki/Boek/FrancissenEchtelt).

From the first discussions within the PLDN-community about promising Solid use cases, the home vault was one of the use cases that remains high on our list of use cases that we would like to work on. Also, the persons that conceived the first idea gave us their consent to work on this concept. And similar to the ideas for a PLDN Enterprise Pod Working Group, we can also start a new PLDN Working Group to model a first basic model for a Home Pod the second half of 2021.

Therefore, PLDN is also looking for interested parties that participate in a PLDN Home Pods Working Group and when other organizations have already started modelling activities in this direction then we would like to collaborate with them to accelerate activities around this topic.

Please contact Pieter van Everdingen via (<mailto:info@pldn.nl>) when you would like to participate in a PLDN Home Pods Working Group.
