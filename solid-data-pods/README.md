# Solid data pods

During the Solid Meetups in the Netherlands, that PLDN has been involved in, we discussed many possible Solid use cases and many possible pod types for persons, enterprises and for communities. Regarding possible pod types, the following list gives an overview of the top 3 that we would like to work on within PLDN Working Groups to define the basic container hierarchy structures for those pods, the first resource type definitions and permission models.

* [Home pods](https://github.com/pldn/solid-activities/tree/main/solid-data-pods/home-pods)
* [Enterprise pods](https://github.com/pldn/solid-activities/tree/main/solid-data-pods/enterprise-pods)
* [PLDN Community pod](https://github.com/pldn/solid-activities/tree/main/solid-data-pods/pldn-community-pod)

Please contact Pieter van Everdingen via info@pldn.nl when you would like to participate in any data modelling activities for the topics mentioned above. Most likely, PLDN would like to start Working Group activities for these topics the second half of 2021 when the Shape Trees Specification has become more stable and we can collectively learn more about how to model data structures in pods via the best practices we can collectively develop parallel to or in co-operation with other Solid Community activities worldwide.
