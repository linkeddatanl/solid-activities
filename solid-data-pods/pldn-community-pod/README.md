<H1> PLDN Community Pod</H1>

This is an idea for a promising Solid use case that has already been discussed during several Solid Meetups. And it can als be a possible follow up activity of the PLDN Linked Data Thesaurus Working Group activities. We can base this activity upon the lightweight OWL-based PLDN Community Ontology from the PLDN Linked Data Thesaurus Working Group that defines the persons, organizations and activities of PLDN. As a next step we can design a SHACL-based PLDN Community Schema that makes use of Shape Trees (check the [Specification](https://shapetrees.github.io/specification/spec) and the [Primer](https://shapetrees.github.io/specification/primer) for more information) to define a folder structure and the data structures for the source, meta and provenance data that we would like to store in a PLDN Community Pod.
