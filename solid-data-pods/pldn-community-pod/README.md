<H1> PLDN Community Pod</H1>

This is a new idea for a promising Solid use case. As a possible follow up after the PLDN Linked Data Thesaurus Working Group activities, we can initiate this activity based upon the lightweight OWL-based PLDN Community Ontology. As a next step we can design a SHACL-based PLDN Community Schema that makes use of Shape Trees to define a folder structure and the data structures for the source and meta and provenance data that we would like to store in a PLDN Community Pod.
