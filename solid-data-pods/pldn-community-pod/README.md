<H1> PLDN Community Pod</H1>

The idea for a <strong>PLDN Community Pod</strong> has already been discussed during several [Solid Meetups](https://github.com/linkeddatanl/solid-activities/tree/main/solid-meetups) (e.g. Solid Utrecht and The Hague). 

And it can be a possible follow up activity of the [PLDN Linked Data Thesaurus Working Group](https://github.com/linkeddatanl/pldn-vocabularies) activities. We can base a PLDN Community Pod upon the lightweight OWL-based <strong>PLDN Community Ontology</strong> that defines the persons, organizations and activities of PLDN and the <strong>PLDN Publication Ontology</strong> that defines the deliverables of PLDN. As a next step we can design a SHACL-based <strong>PLDN Community Schema</strong> and <strong>PLDN Publication Schema</strong> that makes use of <strong>Shapes</strong> and <strong>Shape Trees</strong> to define a folder structure and the data structures for the source, meta and provenance data that we would like to store in a PLDN Community Pod. Check the [Specification](https://shapetrees.org/TR/specification/) and the [Primer]https://shapetrees.org/TR/primer/index.html) for more information on Shape Trees. Shape Trees are used in e.g. in a NHS Solid pilot project in England.
