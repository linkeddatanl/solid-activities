<H1> PLDN Community Pod</H1>

The idea for <strong>PLDN Community Pod</strong> has already been discussed during several [Solid Meetups](https://github.com/linkeddatanl/solid-activities/tree/main/solid-meetups) (e.g. Solid The Hague). And it can als be a possible follow up activity of the <strong>[PLDN Linked Data Thesaurus Working Group](https://github.com/linkeddatanl/pldn-vocabularies)</strong> activities. We can base this activity upon the lightweight OWL-based <strong>PLDN Community Ontology</strong> from the PLDN Linked Data Thesaurus Working Group that defines the persons, organizations and activities of PLDN. As a next step we can design a SHACL-based <strong>PLDN Community Schema</strong> that makes use of <strong>Shape Trees</strong> (check the [Specification](https://shapetrees.github.io/specification/spec) and the [Primer](https://shapetrees.github.io/specification/primer) for more information on Shape Trees) to define a folder structure and the data structures for the source, meta and provenance data that we would like to store in a PLDN Community Pod.
