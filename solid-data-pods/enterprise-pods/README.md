# Enterprise pods

The idea for enterprise pods (and company profiles) has been discussed at a [PLDN event](https://www.pldn.nl/file_auth.php/pilod/2/20/20210120_KVK_Linked_Data_Challenge_-_Solid_Bedrijfsprofiel.pdf) (pdf) on January 20, 2021 during the PLDN-KVK Linked Data Challenge.

This discussion within the PLDN-community was inspired by a statement by Ruben Verborgh on Twitter that a Solid pod can act as a universal digital gateway to all aspects of your life. Similar to that statement you can state that a Solid enterprise pod can act as a universal digital gateway to all aspects of your business activities.

PLDN is looking for interested parties that want to participate in a PLDN Working Group the second half of 2021 to model the basic structure of a container hierarchy in an enterprise pod and the desirable resource types shapes for small business enterprises, starting with a first basic model for freelancers.

We expect that the [Shape Trees Specification](https://shapetrees.org/TR/specification/) is stable enough the second half of 2021 to start more modelling and implementation activities around this specification to build up more best practices for shape trees. Given the commonality and variety in business activities, we would like to define a first model using shapes and shape trees that can form the basis for a number of interoperable Solid business apps. And we would also like to use this activity to find out how much flexibility you can have in container hierarchies and resource type definitions without losing interoperability between overlapping Solid apps.
