<H1>Solid activities</H1>

This repository is part of the Solid activities that PLDN is involved in. 

<em>Please be aware that PLDN has no ownership in the Netherlands for initiating Solid activities. Anybody can initiate Solid activities in the Nerherlands and within the worldwide Solid community. For more information see the <strong>[Solid project](https://solidproject.org/)</strong> website.</em>

The data storage in Solid data pods is based upon linked data. In a data pod you can store any kind of data and the meta and provenance data of that data is defined as linked data in Turtle files (e.g. who adds what, when, etc.). So, a data pod is nothing more than a data container and a data storage place for your personal data. The big advantage of this solution is that you can manage your personal data in your pod yourself and share it securely with others via the use of Solid apps. You are in control of your personal data. And Your data stays in your pod (and is stored only oncle without unnecessarry copies) and other data can be linked to your data in a uniform way via Solid apps.

The role of PLDN in Solid activities is, given the fact that data storage in your pod and linking of data between data elements inside your pod an to data sources outside your pod is based upon linked data, that we want to stimulate further adoption of Solid data pods usage, more usage of existing Solid apps, the development of new Solid apps and the availability of more local pod providers in such a way that the local and worldwide Solid ecosystem can grow to full maturity and to sustainable and scalable solutions in the foreseeable future. Solid has huge potential, but it needs the support from everybody that believe in this improved version of the Wolrd Wide Web.

For each new Solid activity that PLDN is involved in, we will create a new sub folder. Please contact us at <info@pldn.nl> when you have new ideas for Solid activities that you would like to organize or what you would like to develop that PLDN can decide how we can support those initiatives and share our Solid knowledge and experience.
