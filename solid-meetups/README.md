# Solid Meetups

PLDN has been involved in organizing Solid Meetups and Lectures with local organizers in Utrecht, Amsterdam, The Hague and Enschede (see the sub folders in this folder). 

We have stopped organizing these local meetups with our involvement during the Corona pandemic and made our contributions via the monthly online [Solid World](https://solidproject.org/events) events. In the mean time we are also investigating how we can co-operate more with the [Belgium](https://overheid.vlaanderen.be/informatie-vlaanderen/nieuws-en-agenda/solid-ecosysteem) and EU activities for Solid (also via local government institutions and other persons in the Solid network in the Netherlands). 

And We expect that we can start organizing local Solid Meetups again with local organizers from September 2021 onwards. More to follow soon.
