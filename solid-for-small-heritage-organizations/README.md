This project was initiated by NDE and PLDN with Cultural Heritage Brabant and Limburg involved and was co-funded by DigiBeterNL. The Solid for small heritage organizations project is a project to investigate the feasibility of a data management environment for digital cultural heritage collections based on Solid data pods.

We will refer in this folder to the official project repositories on Github once available.
